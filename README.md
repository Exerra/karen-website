This webiste is now featuring 100% more React and 100% more server side rendering. It is based on [this template](https://github.com/Nouridio/Discord-bot-website-template)

## Development

You will be running two processes during development but with one command:

- The Miniflare server (Miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

```sh
# run concurrently command which will launch both the remix server and miniflare
$ npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!
